# Simple Flask RESTful API

This repository contains a basic RESTful API built using the Flask framework in Python. The API offers essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing users. It serves as a foundation for building more complex APIs with Flask and is ideal for developers looking to get started with web development in Python.

# Key Features

- GET /users: Fetches all user records.
- GET /users/{id}: Retrieves the details of a user by their unique ID.
- POST /users: Allows you to create a new user by sending data in JSON format.
- PUT /users/{id}: Updates an existing user record.
- DELETE /users/{id}: Removes a user by their ID.

 # Requirements
 
Before running this API, make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-flask-api.git
cd simple-flask-api
```

2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python libraries, particularly Flask:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

pip install Flask
```

3. Run the Application
Once everything is set up, run the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
